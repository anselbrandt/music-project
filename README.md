# Music Project

This repo will contain links to datasets, papers, and prior work related to melody extraction and chord extraction, leading to an eventual model for melody and chord generation, primarily of jazz music.

This repo wil also contain notebooks and experimental code and libraries necessary for the eventual development of the melody and chord generating application.

An alternative approach would be to forego melody and chord extraction, and train a model on sheet music or MIDI files, specifically on the corpus of jazz lead sheets from fake books.
